    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Hi, 👋 I'm John!</h1>
    <p>
        As a software dev, I thrive on leading teams to turn innovative ideas
        into a reality and learning some cool things along the way. I love
        tinkering, building, exploring new interests, and chatting with other
        chronic hobby collectors. My sweet spot is where technology meets
        creativity, which is probably why my desk alternates between a crisp,
        clean designer's workspace and an arcane wizard's art studio. 🧙🏻 I can't
        promise all my posts here will be perfectly polished, but I can
        guarantee they'll reflect my current obsessions in tech, design, and
        beyond. Hopefully, something catches your eye and we can chat about it!
