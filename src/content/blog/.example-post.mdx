# Writing Blog Posts

This is an example of a blog post for the Arcane Grain blog. Use this as a template when creating new posts.

## Frontmatter Requirements

All posts **must** include:

- `title` (string): The post title
- `description` (string): A short description for SEO and feed
- `pubDate` (string, coerced to Date): Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format

Optional fields:

- `updatedDate` (string, coerced to Date): Last update date if different from `pubDate`
- `heroImage` (image): Relative path to a cover image in `src/assets/images/` (sized 1020×510 in `BlogPost.astro`). Use relative path like `../../assets/images/your-image.jpg`

## File Naming

Place new posts in `src/content/blog/` with the pattern:

```
YYYY-mm-dd-slug.md
```

Example: `2025-01-15-example-post.md`

## Content Format

Write content in Markdown or MDX. The file will be automatically rendered using `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro`.

- Dates are formatted via `src/components/FormattedDate.astro`
- Images are responsive and sized appropriately
- All imports should use the `@/*` path alias (e.g., `@/components/MyComponent.astro`)

**Note:** This is a template file. Files prefixed with a dot (`.`) are automatically excluded from Astro content collections, so this file won't appear in the blog index, RSS feed, or sitemap. You can safely keep it as a reference.
