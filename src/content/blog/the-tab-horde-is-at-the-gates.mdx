I'm done accumulating browser tabs.

Each one sits there with a glazed, vacant stare, moaning for attention. Before I can finish one, five more "must-read" articles arrive via Slack or BlueSky. The tabs pile up, encroaching on my localhost:3000 like a shuffling horde hell-bent on consuming everything in their path. Their only goal is to get me to join them - to stop thinking and just start consuming. By mid-day, the titles have vanished, leaving only a row of vague favicons that look like digital tombstones.

It's a context-switching nightmare. Each tab is a symlink to a synapse in my brain, whispering, "Read me. Consume. Join the horde." It’s cognitive debt I can't afford to pay anymore.

There's only one way to stop the infection: Stop consuming. Start creating.

I finally declared Tab Bankruptcy. I closed the Window of Shame and could almost hear the tiny digital demons wailing as they were sucked back into the LinkedIn ether.

My "Tab Diet" is now strictly enforced. Clickbait? Skip. FOMO-laden "You must learn this or die" posts? Trashed. I’m timeboxing consumption because, let's be honest: nobody gets promoted for having 400 open tabs. And with RAM prices being what they are, I can’t afford to keep that many zombies in my memory.

We don't learn by reading; we learn by hitting the wall. We learn when the build fails, the API returns a 500, and our brains are forced to actually kick into gear. You can't put "Read 5k articles on React" on a portfolio. But you can show off that weird, buggy, brilliant thing you brought into existence.

Pick a silly idea. Pick a mundane one. Recreate something you’ve seen - I guarantee you’ll make it your own once you start breaking things.

Just stop being a human cache for other people's content. Flush the cache and let's create something.
